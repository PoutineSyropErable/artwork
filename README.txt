I used doom Eternal Original and crucible original (downloaded from google image)
to create a doom the final png file (using paint.net)


points were obtained manually with webplot digitalizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) and saved to csv
a screenshot named points is an example of what it looks like. I don't have a SS of the final WPD page, but here's an example. 

The crucible took a day to manually trace so... it's even more points. Sadly, we can't see it. 


run turtle get command and see the print output, it prints a string that is python commands. 
I copy pasted the output and put it inside artwork or artwork bonus


---------------------------
DO were done by manually taking the points in paint.net and converting the coordinates from image type to cartesian.

so, if Bonus = False, only DO is shown. 

OM ETERNAL + Crucible were done by manually adding points on webplotdigitaliser.
