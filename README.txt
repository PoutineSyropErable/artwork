I used doom Eternal Original and crucible original (downloaded from google image)
to create a doom the final png file (using paint.net)


points were obtained manually with webplot digitalizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) and saved to csv
a screenshot named points is an example of what it looks like. I don't have a SS of the final WPD page, but here's an example. 

The crucible took a day to manually trace so... it's even more points. Sadly, we can't see it.
